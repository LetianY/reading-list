# Reading List
This reading list is maintained for personal record.

### 2022 July
1. [Modeling Non-linear Least Squares](http://ceres-solver.org/nnls_modeling.html). This one is about Ceres solver.
2. [A General and Adaptive Robust Loss Function](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_CVPR_2019/papers/Barron_A_General_and_Adaptive_Robust_Loss_Function_CVPR_2019_paper.pdf). This one gives a general form of all sorts of robust loss functions. The github repo can be found [here](https://github.com/google-research/google-research/tree/master/robust_loss).
3. [Conditional Number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Condition_number). This wiki discusses the **well-conditioned** and **ill-conditioned** case.
4. [A robust hybrid of lasso and ridge regression](https://artowen.su.domains/reports/hhu.pdf). This is a paper about huber regression. The sklearn repo can be found [here](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/blob/baf0ea25d/sklearn/linear_model/_huber.py#L126).
5. [Exploring Bayesian Optimization](https://distill.pub/2020/bayesian-optimization/). This is a good tutorial for bayesian optimization. But I haven't got time to read another [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1807.02811.pdf) about this.
6. [GRACGE: Graph Signal Clustering and Multiple Graph Estimation](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9756907). I encountered this paper in the group meeting this month. The proof utilized many techniques I learnt in SEEM5380 (optimization methods for high-dimensional statistics).
7. [Pari-Mutuel Markets: Mechanisms and Performance](https://web.stanford.edu/~yyye/scpmfinal.pdf). This work talks about different mechanisms in the pari-mutuel market. It gives a good explanation for readers to understand how the optimization problem is formulated.
